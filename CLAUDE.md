# Founder OS

Private life-and-business operating system for a single user (Laurenz).
PWA on iPad Pro, cloud data in Supabase, Telegram bot as universal inbox.

## Working agreement

- Explanations, questions and messages to the user: **German**.
- Code, comments, variable names, UI labels: **English** (user chose all-English UI).
- Ask open questions (max 8, German) before coding; build in phases; after every
  phase: commit → push → deploy → live URL + 3-line German summary for iPad testing.
- Boring, reliable solutions. Small dependency footprint. Never put secrets in code.
- Anything that can fail silently (webhook, cron) must log and surface in the
  "SYS // STATUS" footer (`components/system-status.tsx`).

## Tech stack

- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4 (tokens via `@theme` in `app/globals.css`)
- Supabase: Postgres + Auth (single user, email + password) + RLS ON
- Vercel hosting, auto-deploy from GitHub (`el11v11n/founderos`)
- PWA: `app/manifest.ts` + `public/sw.js` (no caching by design) + `public/apple-touch-icon.png`
- Anthropic API (small model) for capture classification (Phase 2+)
- Telegram Bot API via webhook → Vercel serverless route (Phase 3)
- Charts: Recharts (installed; see `components/sparkline.tsx` for the house style:
  2px accent line, faint gradient fill, zero baseline, hover tooltip, no axes on sparklines)

## Architecture

- `app/` — App Router pages. Modules: `/` (HOME), `/brain`, `/crm`, `/ventures`,
  `/finance`, `/calendar`, `/goals`, `/journal`.
- `components/` — shared UI (`card.tsx` = base card with "01 // LABEL" header,
  `top-nav.tsx`, `system-status.tsx`, `greeting.tsx`, `ui.tsx` = Delta/Meter/Tag/EmptyState,
  `sparkline.tsx`, `demo-toggle.tsx`).
- `components/home/` — one file per HOME card (operator, capture, tasks, habits,
  finance, calendar, goals). Grid breakpoints: `md` = 2 cols, `lg` = 4 cols
  (iPad landscape is 1194px — never use `xl` for iPad layouts!).
- `lib/env.ts` — feature/config detection (app must build & run without any env vars).
- `lib/supabase.ts` — browser client factory, returns `null` when unconfigured.
- `lib/demo-mode.tsx` — DemoModeProvider + useDemoMode (localStorage-backed).
- `lib/demo-data.ts` — all demo-mode sample data, only rendered when demo is ON.
- `scripts/generate-icons.mjs` — regenerates all PWA icons from inline SVG (`node scripts/generate-icons.mjs`).

## Design tokens (see `app/globals.css`)

- Background `#0a0b0c`, surface `#121416`, border `#1f2427`, text `#e8eae6`,
  muted `#8a9490`, faint `#5c6663`.
- Single accent: sage `#6ea482` (strong `#8fc4a3`, dim bg `--accent-dim`),
  negative `#c4756b` (text variant `--negative-strong` `#d9958c`).
- All status colors pass WCAG 4.5:1 on surface/background; deltas always ship
  arrow + sign so color is never the only channel.
- Fonts (next/font): Inter (sans/body), JetBrains Mono (numbers, module labels,
  console text), Instrument Serif italic (personal touches, greetings).
- Module labels: small mono caps, numbered — `01 // OPERATOR`, `02 // SESSION`, …
- DEMO ON/OFF toggle (in top nav since Phase 1): demo shows sample data, real mode
  shows user data or per-card empty states — never mixed.

## Env vars (names only — values live in Vercel / .env.local)

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (server-only, Phase 3 webhook)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (Phase 2+)
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_CHAT_ID` (Phase 3)

## Database schema

None yet — Phase 2 introduces the full schema + migrations
(tasks, ideas, events, contacts, habits, goals, journal, transactions, captures).
Transactions must be provider-agnostic (Revolut CSV v1, GoCardless bank API v2,
no schema change between them).

## Telegram pipeline (Phase 3, the heart)

1. Webhook verifies `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` + sender chat ID == `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_CHAT_ID`; others ignored silently.
2. Voice → transcribe (Phase 4) → text; text → Anthropic classification → strict JSON
   `{type, title, details, date, time, amount, currency, contact_name, venture, tags, confidence}`.
3. `confidence < 0.6` → BRAIN inbox as "unsortiert" instead of guessing.
4. German confirmation reply + "undo" for the last capture.
5. Phase 5: daily 07:30 morning briefing via Vercel Cron.

## Phase roadmap

- **Phase 0 — Setup** ✅ scaffold, dark shell, nav, PWA installable, Supabase client stub, deployed.
- **Phase 1 — Core dashboard** ✅ HOME with all 7 cards (capture, operator, finance
  pulse + sparkline, today, habits, calendar, goals), demo-mode toggle, iPad responsive.
- **Phase 2 — Real data**: schema + migrations, auth (single user), CRUD for all modules, in-app Capture → classification pipeline.
- **Phase 3 — Telegram**: webhook 24/7, text capture classified + filed + confirmed + undo.
- **Phase 4 — Voice + Finance**: transcription (key TBD), expense capture, Revolut CSV import (mapping + dedupe), finance charts.
- **Phase 5 — Intelligence**: CRM follow-up flags, weekly review, morning briefing cron, polish (empty/loading/error states).

## Current status (updated 2026-07-11 — read this first in a new session)

- Phase 0 ✅ (PR #1 merged) · Phase 1 ✅ (PR #2 merged) + polish round (PR #3
  merged, PR #4 = "airier layout + centered" pending merge at time of writing).
- **Next up: Phase 2** (schema, auth, CRUD, capture pipeline). Open questions
  sent to user, answers pending:
  1. Is Supabase project created + both `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_*` vars set in Vercel?
     (Footer still showed "DB NOT CONFIGURED" at last check.)
  2. Migrations via (a) SQL scripts user pastes into Supabase SQL Editor
     (recommended) or (b) Supabase keys as env vars in the Claude environment.
  3. Confirm login email = laurenz.geissler@proton.me (password set by user).
  4. Confirm habit list: Gym, Deep Work, Reading, Sales Practice.

### Workflow with the user (established, keep it)

- Work on branch `claude/founder-os-phase-0-inm4tv`; after its PR merges,
  reset it from `origin/main` (`git checkout -B <branch> origin/main`) and
  force-with-lease push. User merges PRs himself on GitHub; Vercel auto-deploys
  `main`. Verify layout with Playwright screenshots (1194×834 and 834×1194)
  before every push.
- Commit messages + PR bodies: German. Give the user a 3-line German summary
  plus screenshots (SendUserFile) after each phase.

### Design feedback learned (do not regress)

- User found the compressed layout "gequetscht" → generous spacing wins over
  fitting one screen. Some vertical scrolling in landscape is ACCEPTED.
- Content font sizes one tick larger (15px for card content) — keep.
- Card arrangement on HOME is approved and fixed: capture(2)+operator+finance /
  today(2, tall)+habits+calendar / goals(2) on lg.

## User context (build around this)

- Café München (from Sept 2026, venture #1): countdown, milestones, later daily KPIs
  (revenue, guests, avg ticket, Wareneinsatz %, Personalkosten %).
- Hotel Österreich (father's 14-room hotel, testbed): occupancy %, ADR, ideas pipeline (BRAIN tag "Hotel").
- Holding (future): milestone tracker, activates when revenue exists.
- Valuable personal network → CRM follow-up cadence is a first-class feature.
- User keys available: Anthropic ✅, Telegram bot ✅. Voice/transcription key: none yet (text-only first).
